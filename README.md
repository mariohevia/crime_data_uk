# UK Crime Maps
A free and open-source project designed to visualise and analyse geospatial crime data from across the UK.

This project uses interactive crime maps to present publicly available data on crime and policing in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Additionally, it provides valuable insights through intuitive visualisations and analyses.

## To dos

+ Check taipy as an alternative option to streamlit.

+ Add option to show more months, not just the last one.

+ Show the radius for crimes in map_click.

+ Add a way to show crimes per location and not a radius around the click in map_click.
    + Show the location boundary.

+ Show some statistics below the map of the crimes shown.

+ Mention that for locations in Scotland, only the British Transport Police provide data for Scotland, therefore, crime levels may appear much lower than they really are. 
    + Mention that Manchester does not report their crime data.

+ Move crime category and selected location to below the map.

+ Accept enter as button click in the postcode map.

+ Add project to my website as an embedding.

+ Play around with st.set_page_config() to costumise the app more (e.g. changing layout to wide -- layout="wide").
    + Ensure that st.columns behave well and improve the default widths etc.

+ Add proper comments to all functions
